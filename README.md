## Team Communication and Participation:

We would be using the agile approach for this project. We will have weekly meetings with the client to update the status of project. We will gather the requirements from clients and appropriate action will be taken. As a team we are not going to let anyone and anything down in project. Everyone in the team are supportive to the other individuals. The weakness we have as an individual are not visible as we have other members to cover them. We will daily meetings through zoom to know the status of project and help each other if anyone fall behind. We will be communicating using Northwest Email and Skype for Business to have quick online meetings
