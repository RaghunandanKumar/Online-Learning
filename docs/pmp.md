## Project Quality Management Plan

A Quality Management Plan (QMP) helps guides the program Manager and project personnel execute quality management and quality assurance activities for a project or program. The purpose of the QMP is to describe how quality will be managed throughout the lifecycle of the project. Quality management planning determines quality policies and procedures relevant to the project for both project deliverables and project processes, defines who is responsible for what, and documents compliance. A QMP is developed by a contractor. Quality is the degree to which the project fulfills requirements.

The QMP identifies these key components:

•	Project Deliverables & Project Processes
•	Deliverable Quality Standards
•	Customer Satisfaction
•	Quality Control Activities
•	Process Quality Standards
•	Stakeholder Expectations
•	Quality Assurance Activities

## Project Risk Management Plan

### Methodology:
Prior to dealing with the project to the customer, we should check the issues and we have to determine the issues with no obstructions. 

### Roles and responsibilities: 
If there is any problem in the project, first we should discover who is liable for these issues, for that the risk manager takes the charge and assess the project. Risk team is liable for settling any risk happened during any phase of the project. 

### Roles and Responsibilities:
Project Manager - Raghunandan Naishadam - Aprroves or Disapproves the tasks <br> Content Developer - Priyanka Bodapati, <br>Full Stack Developer - Mohan Pratapa - main role in developing applications<br> Web Developer - Naga Anshitha Velagapudi

### Budget and schedule: 
There is always risk to cost the projects. To decrease the risk, we execute risk management plan. Risk management team keeps tracks of budget and evaluate the risks. 

### Risk categories: 
In a project, there are various categories of risk included, for example, people risk, technical risk, financial risk, and market risk, structure/process risk. 

### Risk probabilities and impact: 
Risk can be estimated in number of clients, capital, Human Resource, utilization of the website. Risk may happen from numerous points of view. An example model 'A slip in budget' is a case of budgetary division assets. 

### Revised stakeholders’ tolerance: 
Stakeholders risk resistances are the proportions of the level of vulnerability that a Stakeholder acknowledges in regard of the project risk evaluation and they are overhauled during risk management planning. 

### Tracking: 
Each issue happened during the project phase is logged into the issue log. It is tracked until the defect is solved. Week by week surveys help in monitoring the risks making the administration simple to deal with. We ensure that the defects emerge in cycle 1 are not rehashed in cycle 2 by appropriate tracking of the issues.

### Risk documentation:
Documentations are put away in cloud drive and they are refreshed regularly when they are required. Soft copies are useful for simple updating. Prior to going to the meetings, printed copies are kept up.

## Stakeholder Management Plan:
Stakeholder management is critical to the success of every project. Stakeholder management is a strategic discipline that successful project managers use to win and sustain support for their projects from others, both internal and external to their project and to the project's organization.
